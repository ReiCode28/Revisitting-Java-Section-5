# Loops

Here I revisit and practice the Java Fundamentals that I previously learned at Zip Code Wilmington coding bootcamp:

- Using for loops - to run code a specific number of times
- Using while loops - to run code as long as something is true
- Using continue keyword - to skip a run and continue to next one
- Using break keyword - to break out of a loop
- How nested loops run

In the end, I complete a final project "Pokerito!" that tests what I've learned about Loops.
I also build small series of apps to practice what I learn on the way, which can be found here:

# Pokerito!

An interactive app where a user can play Pokerito! It's almost like poker, but the rules much simpler:

- The dealer will give you one card
- And the computer one card
- Then, the dealer will draw five cards (the river)
- The player with the most matches wins. If the matches are equal, everyone's a winner!
